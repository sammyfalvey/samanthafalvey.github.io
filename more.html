<h2> Statements of Interest </h2>
<h3>Business Analytics </h3>
<p>
I am interested in the field of business analytics because I enjoy statistical inference and analyzing data. I also love to code and would enjoy writing programs to accomplish this. My major is business analytics and I feel both satisfied and challenged by my coursework, making it an appealing post-graduation career.
</p>
<p>
A day in the life of an analyst varies by project. I spoke to a business analyst at Capital One. Elizabeth explained that her team starts with a problem and begins writing a program to analyze data. Using statistical modeling and optimization she begins to discover results to draw conclusions. Her and her team work eventually present their findings and solutions to superiors or clients. This balance between coding, math, modeling, teamwork, and presentation appeals to me. I think this field draws my attention as it truly links business and technology. 
</p>
<p>
To stay motivated in this position I would enjoy working at a company that allows movement between teams. I think the work itself is interesting because of the different problems that can be solved. Skills are transferable. For example, Elizabeth is in a rotational program at Capital One. But she said even after the program ends, employees tend to move teams every few years. This would challenge me and prevent me from feeling stuck in a repetitive cycle in my job. 
</p>
<p>
I have the analytical and programming skills to succeed in this field. I first took AP statistics junior year of high school which then inspired me to take data science independently during the following summer. At WashU, I really enjoyed the Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis course. I also love programming, I am experienced in Java and Python. However there is a lot more I'd love to learn. For example SQL is an important tool in data analysis.I also lack the experience in analyzing real world data, which I hope to gain through an internship. 
</p>

<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>
I am also interested in a career in software engineering because I love programming and I think I could be fulfilled in this field. There is constantly more to learn as the technology world develops and I love being a part of that. Software developers are an asset to a company that produces tangible work which makes this role fulfilling.
</p>
<p>
As I explained for business analytics, day-to-day function as a Software Engineer varies. I spoke to Christina, a front end engineer at Amazon to gain more insight. Her experience day-to-day varied by project, but involved a lot of team collaboration during meetings in addition to coding on a variety of platforms. She mentioned object oriented programming as well as web development. The part that intrigued me was her ability to work directly with clients to gain feedback and constantly improve. Her job allows her to impact lives for the better and she expressed that she enjoyed seeing her friends outside of work enjoying her product, too. 
</p>
<p>
I am captivated by the ability to be both creative and analytical all in one role. I would enjoy working with clients and on the UX aspect of a product or service. I would stay motivated by the demands of clients and constantly strive to improve my work. I’d also like to work for a company that allows movement across teams every few years, like I mentioned at Capital One. I think working on new projects would challenge me and prevent me from getting burnt out or tired of one specialization. 
</p>
<p>
While Christina’s role is front end, I have not narrowed down my interests yet. I am skilled in Java, an object oriented language. I am working on skills in Python and C++ as well. I have some web development experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a long way to go improving these skills. I’d really like to gain full stack experience because I think it's not only beneficial, but will also help me narrow my interests. I hope to do so through my WashU course work next semester. I am also exploring internship opportunities in Software Engineering. Coding in the classroom and in the field are very different and I look forward to the exposure I could receive developing software at a company.
