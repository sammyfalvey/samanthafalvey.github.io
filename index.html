My name is Samantha Falvey and I am currently a second year student at Washington University in St. Louis studying Business and Computer Science. My interests lie at the cross-section of business and technology and I am currently exploring a possible career in Software Engineering, Product Management, or Business Analytics.

I have a passion for learning. As a student at WashU, I enjoy the learning that happens every day in my classes. But, if I'm being honest, my favorite place to learn is outside the classroom. 
</p>
<p>
I love to learn new coding languages and skills. I started coding during the pandemic with my Dad. We both registered for a class on Coursera learning Python. I was imediately hooked. It was the first time I did "homework" for a class that would never affect my GPA. It was thrilling and exhausting and I absolutely loved it. Right now I'm creating this website with HTML and CSS which I learned from another Coursera class (shout out <a href="https://www.coursera.org/"> Coursera</a>) just because I wanted to make a website.
</p>
<p>
I also love to learn about people. Although I'm not studying it, psychology intrigues me. I am analytical of those around me and truly empathize with what they're feeling. In other words, I have a high EQ. People are often surprised to hear I am actually an introvert. I value self reflection and alone time. I am able to thoughtfully criticize myself as well as others.
</p>
<p>
I love to learn about places. I have a love for traveling and learning fascinating stories and histories of places around the world. I am fascinated by the varying cultures and societies around the world. Even within the United States, coming to college in St. Louis from Boston has been a learning curve. My goal is to go to every continent (okay, maybe not Antartica). I like to say I've been to 5/7 ... is Aruba in South America?
