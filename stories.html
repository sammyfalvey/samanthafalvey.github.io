  <h3> Showed Leadership </h3>
  <p>I am a teaching assistant for Introduction to Computer Science, which is typically the largest class at WashU. To help students prepare for exams, the class offers a dozen mini assignemnts 
	as options to complete for a small part of the students' overall grade. One of these assignments asks students to solve the following problem: there are
	5 watermelons with different weights and each watermelon is weighed in a pair with another other watermelon to produce 10 paired weights. Given these 10 weights,
	write an algorithm to find the weights of the origonal five watermelons.</p>
	<p>During office hours, I sat down with a student working on the watermelon problem. She had written some code but was stuck on how to find the original five weights.
	As someone who students look up to for help, I never like to simply give them the answer. Doing that would reduce their actual learning and understanding.
	So, I came up with an anology of how I would try to find these weights. I described a lock with a four digit password. I said, "pretend you have to guess the password,
	what would you do? You might start with '1111' then '1112' then '1113' and keep going until you find the answer." This analogy reosnated with her
	and she began coding, using a looping mehcanism to guess each possible watermelon weight. She quickly came to the answer and I felt satisfied that I'd helped her
	come to an answer. As a TA, our job is to make students excited about computer science and feel confident in their success and I make an effort to do so with each student I help.
	Many leaders are knowledgable, but being able to instill knowledge in the people one leads is what makes them successful. </p>

  <h3> Worked with a team</h3>
  <p>I am enrolled in a management communication class in which we work in teams to solve a communication problem for a real business in St. Louis. My team and I are working to help a real estate private equity firm find and retain independent contractors to do maintenance work for their 100 properties across the country. I am someone who enjoys planning, so I begin each meeting asking what we want to discuss and accomplish that day and that week. I usually suggest a plan and then welcome feedback. Our approach for each deliverable of the project has been to split up work evenly and then edit one another’s work Meetings can get boring at times, so I always try to tell jokes or ask about everyone’s day while still making sure to stay on track. Doing this cultivates a more familiar environment to makes my teammates feel comfortable sharing new ideas. I have a high emotional intelligence which allows me to sense moods of teammates and match my attitude accordingly. While we haven’t finished the project or gotten our grade, whatever the outcome I am proud of this team. We worked well together and that allowed us to produce the best possible work. Also, our professor loves our ideas and have given positive feedback throughout the project. </p>

  <h3>Worked with Data</h3>
  <p> have worked with data in many classes beginning in my high school when I took a data science course at UMass Amherst over the summer. Last year I look an upper level statistics and data analysis class and am now enrolled an a managerial statistics course. In the course I’m in now, our culminating project requires us to find data, run a multiple linear regression, and draw conclusions. My team and I are using data from 150 countries to predict gender equality. Our independent variables include access to healthcare, access to sanitation, fertility rates, maternal mortality rates, and female employment rates. Using excel, we calculated descriptive statistics, created a correlation table and scatter plots, and ran a regression. We then used our regression to determine if we should change some variables to natural log models rather than linear models. Our final project turned out to be interesting and we were able to draw statistically significant conclusions about what affects gender equality in a country. </p>

  <h3>Had a conflict </h3>
  <p>This past summer, I worked as a barista at LifeTime’s Cafe and Bistro. I worked in a customer service position all of high school but the cafe customers often posed challenges I didn’t expect. One day, my coworker took an order for a kids meal. The kids meals come with a free juice box, or milk for a $1 uncharge. The customer asked for juice but my coworker must have accidentally hit the milk button on the computer. The customer came back up to complain while I was on register. Our staff was mostly all college aged students and there was rarely with a manger present, so I dealt with the issue myself. She was visibly very irritated about the mistake. I apologized and explained what must have happened and offered a refund. However, with our computer system, I explained that I would have to refund the entire meal and then charge her again for the correct amount. The customer became more upset and raised her voice. I offered a second juice box or milk in substitute but she did not accept. The line behind her began to get longer and I had to fix the problem fast. I reached into our tip jar and handed her a dollar, which finally she accepted and walked away. The next customer told me I handled it well which was reassuring after the exchange. Conflicts can be tough to resolve, especially in a time crunch. Sacrificing a dollar was not my ideal solution, but I am very understanding that my coworker made a mistake and I felt like it was worth it to resolve an escalating conflict. </p>
