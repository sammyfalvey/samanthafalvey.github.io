<h3>Web Development Project</h3>
	<p> Over the summer I took a class throygh Coursera to learn basic web development. One assignment to test our CSS skills challenged us to transform the
		plain HTML website (left video) using CSS. My final product is on the right. This project taught me the power of CSS in transforming a website, but also showed
		me how tedious it can be. The site is not published so I just included the two videos below!
